### RPC Explained

-API consumed by third parties?
-More precisely are you willing to change your API?

The reason is that with REST / GraphQL you build API endpoints without knowing
who the consumer of your API is and what he needs.
With RPC, you build an API for yourself and you know what endpoints you need.
