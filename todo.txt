- Avoid user's TS to autocomplete internal interfaces
- Make client available at `window.telefunc`
- SSR + New context management
- Remove wrong signature warning
- Improve err msg to make it clear that importing in itself is ok, just not using it "[Telefunc][Wrong Usage] The context object `import { context } from "telefunc/client"` is available only in the browser. You seem to try to use it in Node.js. Consider using `import { getContext } from "telefunc/server"` instead."
